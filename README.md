# first_flask_app
This is my first attempt at a flask app. It is based on my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Beijing.

I previously tested this web application many times. In the future, I would like to make the program more defensive by contraining the number of possible tables to an actual number that is in the restaurant and if the user enters a higher table number, warn them.
